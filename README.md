# _traceroute

A minimal command-line utility to trace the path packets take to reach a specified network destination. It sends packets with increasing time-to-live (TTL) values, displaying each hop along the routeâ€”similar to the standard `traceroute` tool.

## Features

- Maps the network path to a target host (domain name or IP address)
- Displays each hop with IP, hostname (if resolvable), and round-trip time
- Supports custom network interface and timeout
- Simple, minimal, and fast
- Linux support

---

## Usage

```
./_traceroute DESTINATION [-i=INTERFACE] [-t=TIMEOUT]

  DESTINATION : domain name or IPv4 address of the target host
  -i          : (optional) network interface to use (default: enp0s3)
  -t          : (optional) network response timeout in seconds (default: 3)
```

---

## Example Output

```
$ ./_traceroute 1337.ma
_TRACing ROUTE to 1337.ma (104.18.32.248)
 ,  from enp0s3 (10.13.100.30)

 2  10.21.1.1 [nat.1337.ma] 0.284 ms

 ...
 8  104.18.32.248 [104.18.32.248] 19.936 ms
```

Supports long routes and handles timeouts/missing hosts:

```
$ ./_traceroute 162.252.205.130
TRC_route to 162.252.205.130 (162.252.205.130)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ip-packet/_traceroute.git
   cd _traceroute
   ```
2. Build the binary (example for C):
   ```sh
   make
   ```
   _(Or follow language-specific build instructions if provided.)_

3. Run as root (required for raw socket operations):
   ```sh
   sudo ./_traceroute <DESTINATION>
   ```

## Requirements

- Linux
- Root privileges (required for sending raw network packets)
- A C compiler and `make` (if building from source)
